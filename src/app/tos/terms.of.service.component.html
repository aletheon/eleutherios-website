    <p style="margin-bottom:8px">These terms of service are effective from 12/20/2020.</p>
    <p>Thanks for using Eleutherios! Our mission is to create a more enlightened way for you to work or serve other people or businesses by providing an intuitive, unified platform, while helping you and those you work with stay coordinated or connected to one another. These terms of service <b>("Terms")</b> cover your use and access to our services, client software and websites <b>("Services")</b>.  Our <a [routerLink]="['/privacy']" style="flex:none;text-decoration:underline;color:#1B1B1B;cursor:pointer">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect and use your information while our <a [routerLink]="['/aup']" style="flex:none;text-decoration:underline;color:#1B1B1B;cursor:pointer">Acceptable Use Policy</a> outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. By using our Services, you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms, our <a [routerLink]="['/privacy']" style="flex:none;text-decoration:underline;color:#1B1B1B;cursor:pointer">Privacy Policy</a>, and <a [routerLink]="['/aup']" style="flex:none;text-decoration:underline;color:#1B1B1B;cursor:pointer">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Your stuff and your permissions</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts, and so on <b>("Your Stuff")</b>. Your Stuff is yours. These Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.</p>
    <p>We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like commenting, sharing, searching, image thumbnails, document previews, optical character recognition (OCR), easy sorting and organization, and personalization to help reduce busywork. To provide these and other features, Eleutherios accesses, stores, and scans Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Your responsibilities</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">Your use of our Services must comply with our <a [routerLink]="['/aup']" style="flex:none;text-decoration:underline;color:#1B1B1B;cursor:pointer">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. Content in the Services may be protected by others intellectual property rights. Please don't copy, upload, download, or share content unless you have the right to do so.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">Eleutherios may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our <a [routerLink]="['/aup']" style="flex:none;text-decoration:underline;color:#1B1B1B;cursor:pointer">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. We aren’t responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">Help us keep Your Stuff protected. Safeguard your password to the Services, and keep your account information current. Don’t share your account credentials or give others access to your account.</p>
    <p>You may use our Services only as permitted by applicable law, including export control laws and regulations. Finally, to use our Services, you must be at least 13 (or older, depending on where you live).</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Software</p>
    <p>Some of our Services allow you to download client software <b>("Software")</b> which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we’ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Beta Services</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">We sometimes release products and features that we’re still testing and evaluating (“Beta Services”). Beta Services are labeled “alpha,” “beta,” “preview,” “early access,” or “evaluation” (or with words or phrases with similar meanings) and may not be as reliable as Eleutherios’s other services. Beta Services are made available so that we can collect user feedback, and by using our Beta Services, you agree that we may contact you to collect such feedback.</p>
    <p>Beta Services are confidential until official launch. If you use any Beta Services, you agree not to disclose any information about those Services to anyone else without our permission.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Our Stuff</p>
    <p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other New Zealand and foreign laws. These Terms don’t grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, others’ content in the Services, Eleutherios trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Copyright</p>
    <p>We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported to us. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Termination</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if:</p>
    <p>(a) you’re in breach of these Terms,</p>
    <p>(b) your use of the Services would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">(c) haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">We’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your Stuff from our Services. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we’ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">We won’t provide notice before termination where:</p>
    <p>(a) you’re in material breach of these Terms,</p>
    <p>(b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or</p>
    <p>(c) we're prohibited from doing so by law.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Discontinuation of Services</p>
    <p>We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond Eleutherios’s control or to comply with a legal requirement. If we do so, we’ll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Services "AS IS"</p>
    <p>We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ELEUTHERIOS AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Limitation of Liability</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">WE DON’T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR ELEUTHERIOS’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN’T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN’T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, ELEUTHERIOS, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON’T BE LIABLE FOR:</p>
    <p>i. ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">ii. ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.</p>
    <p>THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT ELEUTHERIOS OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    <p>IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, ELEUTHERIOS, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. ELEUTHERIOS AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN’T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Controlling Law</p>
    <p>These Terms will be governed by New Zealand law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Entire Agreement</p>
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Eleutherios with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Waiver, Severability & Assignment</p>
    <p>Eleutherios’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Eleutherios may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px">Modifications</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:</p>
    <p>(a) changes to the law,</p>
    <p>(b) new regulatory requirements, or</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">(c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services.</p>
    <p>If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we’ll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:20px">If you don’t agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account before they become effective. Where applicable, we’ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
