    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">Eleutherios is inspired by the everybody-all-at-once or prior unity principle as described in the book, Not-Two Is Peace by Sapta-Na, Avatar, Adi-Da, Samraj. Sapta-Na, describes a circumstance in which people or business processes are already in prior unity with one another or a part of the same forum, request or conversation. And, because this is so, that it is possible to manage that forum, customer request or conversation, digitally, via the internet.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">By presuming that services (people or business) are in relationship with one another or serving one another to begin with, we can scale or manage the forum, customer request or conversation, that they are having.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:10px">For example, if a person is hungry and quarantined at home? They could register with Eleutherios and create a forum for some food.  A grocery store owner could, register as a service and subscribe to the forum and ask the person, what food they wanted?  After listening to their request, the grocery store owner could gather the food from their store and charge the customer directly or wait until the goods we're delivered.  The quarantined person, could have the groceries delivered to them by scaling the forum and creating a sub-forum for a delivery service.  The delivery service, could scale the forum again and create another sub-forum, for a healthcare worker to be the person that delivers the food to the quarantined person.</p>
<pre>Forum (Food)
---- Service (Person or customer)
---- Service (Grocery store owner)
---- Forum (Delivery service)
-------- Service (Person or customer)
-------- Service (Fastpost couriers )
-------- Forum (Healthcare worker to deliver food)
------------ Service (Fastpost couriers or customer)
------------ Service (Healthcare worker )</pre>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">In this example, Eleutherios is scaling or managing the forum, customer request or conversation, that services (people or business) are having about food.  Not the service or work, that they are trying to provide or perform concerning food. People or businesses still provide or perform the same service or work in the world, but within the relevant forum or conversation.</p>
