    <!-- START OF PRIVACY POLICY SECTION -->
    <p>Eleutherios is a global cooperative forum, that presumes people or businesses are in relationship with one another or serving one another, through the same customer request, forum or conversation.</p>
    <br />
    <p>For example, if a person is hungry and quarantined at home? They could register with Eleutherios and create a forum, for some food. A grocery store owner, could register as a service and subscribe to the forum and ask the person, what food they wanted? After listening to their request, the grocery store owner, could gather the food from their store and scale the forum, by creating a sub-forum for a delivery service to delivery the food. The delivery service, could scale the sub-forum again and create another sub-forum, for a healthcare worker to be the person, that delivers the food to the person.</p>
    <br />
<pre>Forum (Food)
---- Service (Person or customer)
---- Service (Grocery store owner)
---- Forum (Pick up + drop off)
-------- Service (Grocery store owner)
-------- Service (Fastpost couriers )
-------- Forum (Healthcare worker to deliver food)
------------ Service (Fastpost couriers)
------------ Service (Healthcare worker )</pre>
    <p>In this example, Eleutherios is scaling or serializing the forum or conversation (Food>Pick up + drop off>Healthcare worker to deliver food), that people or businesses are having.  Not the service or work, that they are trying to provide or perform.  People or businesses, still provide the same product or service in the world, but within the same forum or conversation.</p>
