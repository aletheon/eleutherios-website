    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">Eleutherios is a global cooperative forum, that enables humankind (human or non-human) to serve one another at scale or from the Heart.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">Eleutherios operates like a computer network, where servers subscribe to the network in order to make requests to other servers on the network.  Eleutherios does the same thing, except the server is a person or business, and the request is a forum, customer or conversation.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:10px">People or business are use to serving one another on a local level or one business, per forum or request.</p>
<pre>
Forum (bread x 3)
-- Service (Carpenter or customer)
-- Service (Baker or business)
Forum (10kg flour)
-- Service (Baker or customer)
-- Service (Flour miller or business)
Forum (1kg beef)
-- Service (Butcher or customer)
-- Service (Abattoir or business)</pre>
<p style="margin-bottom:5px">In this example, there is only one business managing each forum or request.  A baker is managing the carpenters request for bread.  A flour miller is managing the bakers request for flour and an abattoir is managing a butchers request for beef.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px">Eleutherios, changes this behavior, by inverting or scaling the forum or request, so that more than one business, can manage it.</p>
<pre>
Forum (Food for family)
-- Service (Carpenter or customer)
-- Service (Baker or business)
-- Service (Butcher or business)
-- Forum (bread x 3)
---- Service (Carpenter or customer)
---- Service (Baker or business)
---- Forum (10kg flour)
------ Service (Baker or customer)
------ Service (Flour miller or business)
-- Forum (1kg beef)
---- Service (Butcher or customer)
---- Service (Abattoir or business)</pre>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px">Now, there are two businesses (baker, butcher) simultaneously managing the carpenters request for food.  They are taking the responsibility for managing the bread and beef or aggregating the conversation, inviting other services to serve, when they are required.</p>
