    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">Eleutherios is a global cooperative forum or digital sociopolitical or economic system, that enables humankind to self-organize with one another at scale through the internet.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/futureOverview2.png" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px">Our approach to unlocking data for systems governance is to presume stakeholders or service providers are in relationship with one another or operating under the same policy, rule, regulation or system. And then, provide them with the tools to be able to scale the forum or network that they are participating in.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px"><b>Advantages</b></p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom:15px">
      <li>Creates global partnerships (Service providers can create and share policies with one another)</li>
      <li>Builds capacity (Service providers can create a non-redundant forum or customer request)</li>
      <li>Improves livelihoods or equality (Service providers can create new businesses or business models)</li>
      <li>Reduced cost of goods and materials, waste and inefficiencies (Service providers can manage the entire value chain from supplier to consumer)</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="../../assets/currentOverview3.png" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px">What we discovered is that the current human sociopolitical or economic system, presumes that services providers are not in relationship with one another or operating under different policies, rules or regulations.  Service providers do not have the tools to scale their request or network and have other service providers join.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px"><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom:15px">
      <li>Creates local partnerships (Service providers cannot create and share policies)</li>
      <li>Prevents capacity building (Service providers cannot create a non-redundant forum or customer request)</li>
      <li>Impairs livelihoods (Service providers cannot create new businesses or business models)</li>
      <li>Increases cost of goods and materials, waste and inefficiencies (Service providers cannot manage the entire value chain from supplier to consumer)</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="../../assets/priskaService.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">Priska can register with the website and create a service. She can give it a price, title, description, website url and tags.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/selectForum.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">End users can search for services such as Priska’s and request her service by clicking on the plus symbol to create a forum.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/newForum.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">In this example, Moin wants access to barley yield data from Priska and has added himself (Hire My Farmer) and Priska (Gyga) to the forum.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/subforum.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">Service providers communicate with one another by sending text messages through the forum. They can click the plus button on the services tab to keep adding more services to the conversation or click the sub-forum button to create a feedback loop to separate the concerns of each request.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/separatingConcerns.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">Separating the concerns of each request is important, because it enables service providers to focus on the data or service that they are able to provide. In this case Moin wants to separate the concerns of managing Barley yield data away from Barley yield farming and delegates the responsibility to another service provider, John (Barley Farming Ltd) to manage. In our MVP, service providers who create forums, don’t have to be the ones that manage it. Any service provider can manage the forum, depending on whether they have been invited or not.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/parentLevel.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">At the parent level sub-forums show up in a list and can be navigated to by clicking on them.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/breadcrumb.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">At the child level the parent shows up as a breadcrumb, where the service provider can navigate their way back up the tree by clicking on the parent forum.</p>
