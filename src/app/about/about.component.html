    <p style="margin-bottom:6px">Eleutherios is a sociopolitical or economic system or value chain, that lets service providers cooperate with one another through the same forum or network.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px">Service providers are able to scale their forum and invite other service providers to help them manage their forum or network.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px">There are many benefits in this way of operating including:</p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom:15px">
      <li>Global governance or partnerships (Service providers can cooperate or share in the same policy or system)</li>
      <li>Non-redundant customer request (Service providers can scale their forums and invite other service providers to help them manage their sociopolitical or economic needs or concerns)</li>
      <li>A healthier, resilient human environment or community (Service providers cooperate with one another, they don't compete)</li>
      <li>Improved livelihoods (Service providers can create policies or business models, that are fair on all participants involved in the network or value chain)</li>
      <li>Reduced cost of goods and materials, waste and inefficiencies (Service providers are given tools to manage the entire value chain from supplier to consumer)</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-bottom:6px">In this example Hire My Farmer wants to use the Barley yield data, that they're getting from GYGA to share with another service provider.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">They can click on the plus button to create a sub-forum in the Barley yield data forum and include the service provider they want to share the data with.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/breadcrumb.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">Service providers can navigate their way through the conversation using a virtual breadcrumb.</p>
