    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">Eleutherios is a global cooperative forum or prior unity of humankind (human or non-human), to serve one another at scale or from the Heart.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">Eleutherios operates like a computer network, where servers subscribe to the network in order to make requests to other servers on the network.  Eleutherios does the same thing, except the server is a person or business, and the request is a forum or customer.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:10px">People or businesses, are use to serving one another on a local level or one business, per forum or request.</p>
<pre>
Forum (Lump under armpit)
-- Service (Mary or customer)
-- Service (Doctor or business)
Forum (Insurance claim)
-- Service (Doctor or customer)
-- Service (NZ Insurance or business)
Forum (Mammogram test)
-- Service (NZ Insurance or customer)
-- Service (Radiologist or business)</pre>
<p style="margin-bottom:5px">In this example, there is only one business managing each of the three forums.  A doctor is managing, Mary's forum for a lump under her armpit. An insurance company is managing the doctor's forum for an insurance claim, and a radiologist is managing the insurers forum for a mammogram test.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px">Eleutherios, changes this way of serving, by inverting or scaling the forum or request, so that more than one business can manage it.</p>
<pre>
Forum (Lump under armpit)
-- Service (Mary or customer)
-- Service (Doctor or business)
-- Forum (Insurance claim)
---- Service (Doctor or customer)
---- Service (Healthcare Insurance or business)
---- Forum (Mammogram test)
------ Service (Healthcare Insurance or customer)
------ Service (Radiologist or business)</pre>
<p style="margin-bottom:5px">In this example, there is more than one business or service (doctor, healthcare insurer, radiologist) all cooperating with one another, through the same forum, for a lump under Mary's armpit.  Each service is being invited by another service, through a sub-forum to manage, that aspect of the request or conversation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px">This way of managing a request is circular or a network, because it's the request that is being scaled, not the service or work, that people or businesses are performing.  People or businesses still pay one another or provide the same service, or work in the world.  But, within the same forum or conversation.</p>
