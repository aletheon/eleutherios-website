    <p style="margin-bottom:6px">Eleutherios is a digital, sociopolitical or economic system, that enables humankind to self-organize with one another at scale, through the same forum or network.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">It does this by scaling the customers request over the service layer to enable more than one service provider to participate in the same forum or network.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/currentOverview.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px">The current analogue, sociopolitical or economic system does the opposite. Only one service provider can participate in the customer request at a time.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px">For example the request between the bank and farmer is local to the bank and farmer.  Likewise the request between the retailer and Mary Smith, and so on.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">If the bank or retailer can't provide money or food to their respective customers, then there is no way for them to scale the request to find somebody who can.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/subforum.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px">Eleutherios changes this behavior by making the forum or request scalable. In this example Hire My Farmer wants to use the Barley yield data, that they're getting from GYGA to share with another service provider.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">They can click on the plus button to create a sub-forum in the Barley yield data forum and include the service provider they want to share the data with.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/breadcrumb.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px">The main advantage to doing this is that it separates the concerns of each service provider. Service providers are able to take the responsibility for managing their request or concerns of their customers.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:15px">In the above example, the Barley yield farming forum is a child of the Barley yield data forum. Service providers can navigate their way through the conversation using a virtual breadcrumb.</p>
    <img src="../../assets/priskaService.jpg" style="margin-bottom:15px" />
    <p style="margin-bottom:6px">The current version of Eleutherios provides basic tooling such as creating a forum, creating a sub-forum, creating a service, searching for forums or services, and purchasing services.</p>
