# Eleutherios

Eleutherios (https://eleutherios.org.nz) is a global cooperative forum, customer request or conversation, among humankind.

People or businesses are use to serving one another on a one-to-one basis or one customer per forum or request.

```bash
Forum (Food)
-- Service (Person or customer)
-- Service (Grocery store owner)
Forum (Delivery service)
-- Service (Grocery store owner or customer)
-- Service (Fastpost couriers)
Forum (Healthcare worker to deliver food)
-- Service (Fastpost couriers or customer)
-- Service (Healthcare worker)
```

Eleutherios, does the opposite and inverts or scales the forum or customerâ€™s request, so that it operates on a many-to-many basis or many customers per forum or request.

```bash
Forum (Food)
-- Service (Person or customer)
-- Service (Grocery store owner)
-- Forum (Delivery service)
---- Service (Grocery store owner or customer)
---- Service (Fastpost couriers)
---- Forum (Healthcare worker to deliver food)
------ Service (Fastpost couriers or customer)
------ Service (Healthcare worker)
```

In this example, there is more than one customer, being served by the forum for food.

#### Features:

* Forum in forum (scalability)
* Tags for filtering forums or services (search)
* Blocking to prevent unwanted services or users from serving in forums, they have been asked not to serve in or for requesting services, they have been asked not to request (accountability)
* Service ratings/reviews (trust)
* Payments (resilience)
* Shared process or manifest (redundancy)
* AI (automation)

Eleutherios is built with a real-time pub/sub, node.js, nosql (Firestore) backend and an HTML/CSS (Angular) frontend.

### 2. Login to firebase and deploy functions folder

Eleutherios uses functions to modify the behavior of the system and its data before or after it is created, updated or deleted in the system.  If you are planning on doing work on the backend API, then you should install firebase functions to help you test your work before committing it.

```bash
i.   cd functions

iii. firebase deploy --only functions
```

### 3. Setup firebase

It's important to setup your firebase backend to work with the source code.

```bash
i.    enable firebase authentication (email/password, google, facebook)
ii.   create a totals table in firebase not firestore, with the following default structure:
        totals
          forum
            count: 0
          service
